# Exercise 1
# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
#
# Extras:
# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

import datetime

name = input('Tell me your name, please...')
age = input('Tell me your age now...')
now = datetime.datetime.now()



print('Your name is {}'.format(name))
print('Your age is {}'.format(age))

the_string ='You wil be 100, or maybe you acctually was, in {} year'.format(now.year+100-int(age))
print(the_string)

repeats = input('How many repeats of the last string do you want?')

for i in range(0,int(repeats)): print(i+1," - ",the_string)

print('\n\n\nYou can multiply strings the same way as adding them, did you know that?')

print(4*(the_string, ' / '))
